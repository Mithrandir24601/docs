# [codidact](https://codidact.org/)

A work-in-progress, healthy alternative to the Stack Exchange Network.

This project was created to coordinate and keep track of current efforts by a group of (mostly unsatisfied) users of Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange Network to develop an alternative to these platforms.

All relevant information can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/codidact/docs/wiki). Please make sure to [check out the forum](https://forum.codidact.org) as well. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WZ7aTst) for live chat about the project.
