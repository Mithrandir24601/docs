# [codidact](https://codidact.org/)

A work-in-progress, healthy alternative to the Stack Exchange Network.

This project was created to coordinate and keep track of current efforts by a group of (mostly unsatisfied) users of Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange Network to develop an alternative to these platforms.

Most things (such as specs, ideas etc.) should happen in our [Wiki](https://github.com/zoxuyu/expert-engine/wiki) or our [discord chat](https://discord.gg/WZ7aTst) for now.
